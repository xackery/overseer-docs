# Server Path Empty

This error occurs when the server path in overseer.ini is empty

Remedy Steps:

- Open overseer.ini with a text editor
- Check if there's a server_path entry inside the file
- If not, add one with the pattern `server_path = /path/to/your/server/`, or on windows, `server_path = C:\path\to\your\server\`
- Save the file and restart diagnose to see if the error is gone

Additional Notes:

- The server path is the path to your server's root directory, where eqemu_config.json and most other files reside
- If you're using a custom server path, make sure to use forward slashes `/` on Linux and backslashes `\` on Windows
- Your text editor may have added strange newlines or other characters to the file. Make sure to remove them and use notepad, notepad++, or another simple text editor if you're unsure. Don't use wordpad or word or it may add strange characters to the file
