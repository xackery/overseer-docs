title: "Server Count is Zero"
---

This error occurs when the zone count is zero in the overseer config

If you are not planning to run the overseer.exe, you can ignore this error as it only pertains to zone spin up management.

Remedy Steps:

- Open overseer.ini with a text editor
- Check if there's a zone_count entry inside the file
- If not, add one with the pattern `zone_count = 1`, changing 1 to the number of servers you want to keep up.
- Save the file and restart diagnose to see if the error is gone

Additional Notes:

- The zone count is the number of zones overseer should keep running.
- Your text editor may have added strange newlines or other characters to the file. Make sure to remove them and use notepad, notepad++, or another simple text editor if you're unsure. Don't use wordpad or word or it may add strange characters to the file
