title: "Docker Network is Empty"
---

This error occurs when the docker network field is empty in the overseer.ini config

This means that the setup was configured as docker, but there's incomplete data inside the ini.

By default in this case, the ini will fall back to eqemu, but it is a strange symptom to see and may need further investigation.

You may want to consider renaming overseer.ini to something else and running diagnose again to generate a fresh config.

Remedy Steps:

- Open overseer.ini with a text editor
- Check if there's a docker_network entry inside the file
- If not, add one with the pattern `docker_network = eqemu`, changing eqemu to whatever you'd like to call the network
- Save the file and restart diagnose to see if the error is gone

Additional Notes:

- The docker network is the name of the docker network that the server is running on
- Some names are reserved by docker, such as bridge, host, and none. You will want to avoid these names
