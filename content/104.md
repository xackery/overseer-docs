title: "overseer.ini docker_network is set to none (duplicate)"
---

This error occurs when the docker network field is set to an invalid value in the overseer.ini config

This means that the setup was configured as docker, but was accidentally set to something invalid

By default in this case, the ini will fall back to eqemu, but it is a strange symptom to see and may need further investigation

Remedy Steps:

- Open overseer.ini with a text editor
- Check if there's a docker_network entry inside the file
- If not, add one with the pattern `docker_network = eqemu`, changing eqemu to whatever you'd like to call the network
- Save the file and restart diagnose to see if the error is gone

Additional Notes:

- The docker network is the name of the docker network that the server is running on
- Some names are reserved by docker, such as bridge, host, and none. You will want to avoid these names
