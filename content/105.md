title: "overseer.ini unknown expansion value"
---

This error occurs when the expansion field is set to an invalid value in the overseer.ini config

This means that the installer or a manual edit to overseer.ini put an invalid value.

By default in this case, the ini will fall back to empty, so can potentially be ignored, but having expansion set can be useful for updates.

Remedy Steps:

- Open overseer.ini with a text editor
- Check if there's a expansion entry inside the file
- If not, add one with the pattern `expansion = classic`, changing classic to the expansion you'd like to set.
- Save the file and restart diagnose to see if the error is gone

Additional Notes:

- The expansion is the name of the expansion that the server is running on
