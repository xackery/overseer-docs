This error occurs when overseer.ini is empty.

Remedy Steps:

- Open overseer.ini with a text editor
- Check if there's a server_path entry inside the file
- If not, add one with the pattern `server_path = /path/to/your/server/`, or on windows, `server_path = C:\path\to\your\server\`
- Save the file and restart diagnose to see if the error is gone
